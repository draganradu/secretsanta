# Secret Santa [PHP]
Secret Santa is the most popular activity around Christmas from teenage years to corporate life, and especially corporate life. 
The logistics of Secret Santa are a pain for the person organizing the event, because if you play with a large number of people they forget how they picked, what is the spending limit. So a large Secret Santa pool is going to degenerate in hating people around the holiday times, and lets leave the hating people part for the family reunion.

## Basic use
The script is made in such a way your average secretary that can create a google spreadsheet can use it.

* 1| Create a google spreadsheet.
* 2| Publish it as CSV.
* 3| Copy the link and past it in the input field.
* 4| Print (there is print specific CSS).
* 5| Cut the flyers and distribute.
